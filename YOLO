YOLOv11 Object Detection on Custom Dataset | Step-by-Step Guide
https://youtu.be/A1V8yYlGEkI?si=eeP13TsbXmyrmZcb

THIS FILE CONTENTS:
A comprehensive YOLOv11 custom object detection tutorial with a step-by-step guide for a two-class custom dataset. I cover setting up an environment for YOLOv11, how to annotate custom datasets in YOLO format, and how to train custom object detection models. Although I show a demonstration using YOLOv11 medium version, the method is generic enough to train all variations of YOLOv11 custom object detectors. This tutorial is for both Windows and Linux.
